The mc_listener image

Listener
This image contains, as the primary application, the mc_listener. Simply 
running the image in a container will start the listener. 


Replay
The image also contains a replay binary which has the ability to read a
raw data capture (rdc) file generated by the listener, and to "replay"
the messages by writing them to the appropriate FIFOs in the same manner
as the mc_listener application.  This binary is run using the run_replay.sh
script, and can be piped the file from the native environment:

  docker run -i --rm -v /var/lib/mc/listener:/var/lib/mc/listener run_replay.sh <data-file

Alternately, if multiple data files are to be given as input, something like
the following can be used:

  cat MLCT_* | docker run -i --rm -v /var/lib/mc/listener:/var/lib/mc/listener run_replay.sh

where 'data-file' as the rdc data. The timestamps in the original data are
preserved, but there is no effort to simulate the rate; messages from the raw
data will be written to the FIFOs as fast as possible.  The directory that
the replay binary should write FIFOs to should be mounted (as the example is 
above). If an alternate path must be used, it must be supplied using the -d path
command line option to run_replay.sh.
